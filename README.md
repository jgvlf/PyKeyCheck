# PyKeyCheck
A Python Program that check the key pressed in the computer keyboard.

## How It Work?
Is a terminal app that ask to you press a key on keyboard and show to you, furthermore have a infinite loop to make more than one check.
To end the loop, close the terminal window.

## Observations:
- Have a delay after press the key of 5 miliseconds.
- The order to show the pressed keys is the usual order. If press a sequence that not print anything, show the strange sequence. So press the usual sequence.
